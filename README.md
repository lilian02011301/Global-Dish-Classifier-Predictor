# Global Dish Classifier & Predictor
In this project, the dataset of dish provided by the moduel of ML, and it consists of two parts where each tackles a different problem.

# Basic Component
Demonstrated skills in image classification and predictive modeling within the culinary context by implementing algorithms such as Decision tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, Balanced SVM, and SVM, and in conclusion, Random Forest Classifier has a test accuracy of 84%.

# Advanced Component
In the advanced problem, it was predicted whether a dish is Italian, American, or Chinese based on the ingredients used in it. Implementing Gradient Boosting tree, SVM, Linear SVC, Random Forest Classifier, KNN, and logistic regression and coming to the conclusion to use KNN with 86.43% test accuracy.
