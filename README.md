# Global Dish Classifier & Predictor
In this project, the dataset of dish provided by the moduel of ML, and it consists of two parts where each tackles a different problem.

ÔºÉDataset
For this experiment, We are using files from the milend_RC dataset, which comprises images of both chips and rice dishes. The dataset contains approximately 800 images of rice dishes and 73 images of chips. Consequently, rice images are about 16 times more prevalent than chips images. This significant imbalance in the dataset may lead our classifier to be more biased towards rice during training.

# Basic Component
Demonstrated skills in image classification and predictive modeling within the culinary context by implementing algorithms such as Decision tree, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, Balanced SVM, and SVM, and in conclusion, Random Forest Classifier has a test accuracy of 92.2%.

# Advanced Component
In the advanced problem, it was predicted whether a dish is Italian, American, or Chinese based on the ingredients used in it. Implementing the 'balanced' class weight significantly impacted the model's ability to manage the class imbalance more effectively. It ensured that both the 'very healthy' and 'very unhealthy' categories were adequately represented in the model's decision-making process. As a result, the accuracy adjusted to a more realistic 83.33%, indicating a reduction in the overfitting issue and an improvement in the model's ability.
